Efficient Gas Cost Reduction in Ethereum Through Compression Techniques


This project focuses on optimizing Ethereum gas fees by implementing off-chain data compression before storing data on-chain. By leveraging textual compression algorithms like Zlib and Gzip, it effectively reduces storage costs while maintaining data integrity through cryptographic verification. The project eliminates the need for decentralized storage solutions, enhancing both cost efficiency and scalability. Developed using Solidity, Remix IDE, Ganache, and Python, it evaluates gas consumption before and after compression to demonstrate significant cost savings. This approach ensures secure and optimized blockchain transactions, making smart contract execution more efficient and affordable.

Technology Stack: Solidity, Python
